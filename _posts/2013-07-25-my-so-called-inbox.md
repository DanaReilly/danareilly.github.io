I wish I had been more conscious of my online activity. Not because I’m embarrassed by what’s out there, but because I feel like I didn’t put enough of myself out there. Like a parent carefully documenting every moment of her child’s life, the internet can put together some beautiful scrapbooks of its users’ lives.

I recently learned about [Immersion](https://immersion.media.mit.edu/) in Fast Company’s [Infographic of the Day](). You grant the web app access to your Gmail account, and it compiles data from your email history (looking only at the email headers: From, To, CC, and timestamp fields) to create a visual representation of your social network:

My email interactions since I opened a Gmail account in August 2006.

If I had known how much fun it would be to look back at all my interactions, I would have never given up my AOL screenname. What would *Mochafrappgrrl*’s map have looked like today? ‘[Smarterchild](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/scott-mcclellans-replacement-aol-instant-messenger-bot-smarterchild)‘ definitely would have dominated the map circa 2006. Maybe it wouldn’t have looked very different, since I primarily used my buddy list as a way to know when my crushes were at their computers, more than as a springboard for new conversations.

Immersion is good for spotting outliers, people you haven’t spoken to in years but who are significant enough to appear on the map. The friends I made during my ‘year abroad’ in Jordan, my boss at my first public radio internship. The three-person research team clearly understand what Immersion can do for users, and I’ll end the post in their own words from their site: “It’s about **self-reflection**, **art**, **privacy** and **strategy**.”
